There are such functions as "print" or "read disk" but i think that programmer should implement them for himself in his program with any possible optimisations of code. You also need to switch into protected mode for y such functions as "print" or "read disk" but i think that programmer should implement them for himself in his program with any possible optimisations of code. You also need to switch into protected mode for youself if you need and then return back to real mode when program execution ended.
